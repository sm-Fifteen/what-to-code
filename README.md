# what-to-code
A list of projects I can work on when I don't know what to do with my time. Based on [joereynolds/what-to-code](https://github.com/joereynolds/what-to-code).

* Herod : An heraldry editor.
	* Interesting aspects :
		* Blazon description use some kind of plain-text language with its own syntax
	* Challenges :
		* This could easily become an SVG nightmare just for partitions
		* Sizes of the charges?
* Markdown Adventure : A choose-your-own-adventure spec and parser to make it possible to write simple text-based games in Markdown, possibly with enough hooks to write a full engine around the parser.
	* Interesting aspects :
		* Markdown is surprisingly well-suited to this, once you substitute the right syntaxtic constructs to fulfll the right functions.
		* Markdown parsing lib Marked could make it easy to write such a parser.
	* Challenges :
		* Try to balance the limitations of fitting a language made for markup to work as an interactive fiction language with the conveinience of using a language most people already know from using Reddit and GitHub.
